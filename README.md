# MatchaOrderingSystem

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Matcha Ordering System is a C# WinForms desktop application designed to facilitate the simple and accurate purchasing of matcha products.
Beyond standard order entry and price calculation, the system uses a relational database structure (SQL-based) to ensure robust data integrity.
Crucially, every order is timestamped with the exact date and time it was placed, allowing for accurate historical tracking, reporting, and fulfillment management
